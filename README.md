## Find desired phones on Flip.ro
#### Context
One friend of mine asked me which phone do I recommend him and his wife buying as I am really __passionate about tech__(mobile phones, laptops, PCs, monitors, TVs, Speakers, etc). We established a budget and then I told him about Flip.ro. 
#### What is Flip.ro?
It is a website which sells second-hand mobile phones which are stricly verified and they offer customers 30 days of return and 2 years of warranty. These are __cheaper__ than in shops, and a __safer__ buy than phones from other people.
#### How did I end up making this script?
We searched several days for 2 identical phones(2 Samsung Galaxy S21 of 256GB in _"As new"_ or _"Excelent"_ conditions) but we found none. Their stock is very unpredictable, and sometimes, low too. So, I have created this script which also gave me the __opportunity to learn__ a little bit of __Selenium__, I let it run in the background and in the second day we already found and bought the first phone. After that, I have never used this again, but it was fun creating it and seeing really helping us.
